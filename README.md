# Chicago-CTA-Ridership-Analysis
An analysis of the data from the Chicago CTA Ridership count. Determines the average monthly ridership count, average weekly ridership count and busiest station in Chicago. 
The program is run through Python3 using SQL3.
The primary focus in this program, as an example is the UIC Halsted Station. The program first runs through the entire database and searches
for this station.
Next, it adds up all the rides from the last few years up till the start of the pandemic (To avoid a gap in data).
After that, it calculates it's average weekly rides, i.e., average rides per day for the past 20 years.
Further more, it calculates it's average monthly rides, i.e., average rides per month for the past 20 years.
For the last part of the program, it analyses all of the data and adds up all the rides for each individual station to determine the busiest
station in Chicago over the past 20 years.
